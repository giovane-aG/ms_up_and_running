# OPM2: Team size should be limited

## Status 
Accepted

## Context
The greater the team the greater is the challenge to keep everyone up to date. Keeping smaller teams improves communication and tracking of what people are working on.
## Decision
Teams that perform work in our system should have no more than eight people each

## Consequences
Smaller teams usually mean more teams, so its important to be careful when designing the rest of the system's teams.
It limits the number of specialists that we can have. We need to make sure we have enough talent working on the project.
